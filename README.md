# Spotavibe

This is the second project of the Ironhack bootcamp. We created a web application which creates Spotify-playlists, based on the users heartpulse, with the intention of calming them down. Check it out on http://spotavibe.herokuapp.com/

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For measuring the heartpulse, a heartrate sensor is required. When this is not available, manual options are also accessible.

## Deployment

We deployed using heroku.

## Built With

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Our server environment
